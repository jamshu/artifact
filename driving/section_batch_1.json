        "content": "This module covers the fundamental principles of defensive driving and driver responsibilities.\n\n* Physical and Mental Fitness: \nA driver must always be physically and mentally fit to drive. This includes being free from fatigue, stress, illness, or the influence of alcohol, drugs, or medications that may impair driving ability.\n\n* Defensive Driving Principles: \nDefensive driving means being alert and prepared to avoid accidents caused by the mistakes of other road users. It involves anticipating potential hazards and maintaining situational awareness at all times.\n\n* Driver Obligations: \nEvery driver has the obligation to follow traffic laws, maintain their vehicle in good condition, carry necessary documents (license, registration, insurance), and drive in a manner that does not endanger themselves or others.\n\n* Cooperative Behavior: \nDrivers must show courtesy and cooperation with other road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and emergency vehicles. This includes using proper signals, maintaining safe distances, and yielding right-of-way when required.\n\nUnderstanding that driving is a privilege that comes with serious responsibilities.\n"

        "title": "Speed \u0026 Stopping Distance",
        "content": "Understanding the relationship between speed and stopping distance is critical for the \"Stop in Time\" principle.\n\n* Total Stopping Distance = Reaction Distance + Braking Distance\n\n* Reaction Distance: \nThe distance traveled while the driver recognizes a hazard and begins to brake (typically 0.75-1.5 seconds).\n\n* Braking Distance: \nThe distance required to come to a complete stop once brakes are applied. This varies greatly with speed, road conditions, vehicle condition, and weather.\n\nSpeed must always be adapted to the conditions to ensure safe stopping capabilities.\n"
