# Geidea Payment Status Persistence Bug - Fix Summary

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

**Issue**: After completing a card payment approval, when creating a new order, the payment line automatically moves from "pending" to "done" status without user interaction.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Shared Payment Interface Status**: The `GeideaPaymentInterface.status` persists across payment lines since the same interface instance is reused
2. **Incomplete Connection Cleanup**: WebSocket connections and event handlers weren't fully cleared between transactions
3. **Payment Line Status Inheritance**: New payment lines could inherit previous status values
4. **Stale Message Handlers**: Previous transaction messages could be processed for new payment lines

---

## ✅ **Implemented Fixes**

### 1. **Payment Interface Status Reset** (`payment.js`)

**Fixed in `send_payment_request` method**:
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Reset status for new payment request
this.status = 'pending';

// Ensure the payment line starts with pending status
line.set_payment_status('pending');
```

**Benefits**:
- Forces reset of interface status for each new payment request
- Ensures payment lines always start with correct status
- Prevents status persistence across payment attempts

### 2. **Enhanced Connection Cleanup** (`payment.js`)

**Improved `_cleanup()` method**:
```javascript
// Clear all event handlers to prevent stale responses
this.terminal.onmessage = null;
this.terminal.onerror = null;

// Fallback timeout in case close event doesn't fire
setTimeout(() => {
    if (this.terminal) {
        console.log("Force closing terminal connection");
        this.terminal = null;
    }
    resolve();
}, 1000);
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents stale message handlers from processing old responses
- Ensures complete connection closure with fallback timeout
- Eliminates cross-transaction message processing

### 3. **Complete Interface Reset Method** (`payment.js`)

**New `resetInterface()` method**:
```javascript
resetInterface() {
    console.log('Resetting Geidea payment interface, previous status:', this.status);
    this.status = 'pending';
    
    // Force cleanup any existing connections
    if (this.terminal) {
        try {
            if (this.terminal.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
                this.terminal.send(JSON.stringify({
                    "Event": "CONNECTION",
                    "Operation": "DISCONNECT"
                }));
            }
            this.terminal.close();
        } catch (error) {
            console.warn('Error during force cleanup:', error);
        }
        this.terminal = null;
    }
    
    console.log('Geidea payment interface reset complete');
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Provides complete reset functionality for payment interfaces
- Can be called externally to force interface reset
- Handles connection cleanup gracefully

### 4. **Payment Line Model Initialization** (`models.js`)

**Fixed payment line initialization**:
```javascript
initialize: function(attributes, options) {
    _super_paymentline.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
    
    // Initialize Geidea-specific fields with default values
    this.payment_status = 'pending'; // Always start with pending status
    
    console.log('Payment line initialized with status:', this.payment_status);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures all new payment lines start with 'pending' status
- Prevents inheritance of previous payment statuses
- Provides clear logging for debugging

### 5. **Order Change Handling** (`payment_screen.js`)

**New PaymentScreen extension**:
```javascript
// Hook into order changes
onChangeOrder(this._onOrderChanged.bind(this));

_onOrderChanged(newOrder, previousOrder) {
    console.log('Order changed - Previous:', previousOrder?.uid, 'New:', newOrder?.uid);
    
    // Reset all Geidea payment interfaces when order changes
    if (newOrder && newOrder.uid !== this._currentOrderId) {
        console.log('Resetting Geidea payment interfaces for new order:', newOrder.uid);
        this._resetGeideaPaymentInterfaces();
        this._currentOrderId = newOrder.uid;
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatically resets payment interfaces when order changes
- Prevents cross-order status persistence
- Handles new order creation properly

### 6. **Enhanced Payment Processing** (`payment.js`)

**Improved connection timing**:
```javascript
try {
    // Ensure complete cleanup before starting new payment
    await this._cleanup();
    
    // Small delay to ensure cleanup is complete
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));

    this._setStatus('waiting', line);
    
    await this._initializeConnection();
    await this._processPayment(line);
    
    return true; // Don't set done here, let _updatePaymentLine handle it
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures proper cleanup timing between payments
- Prevents race conditions with connection setup
- Maintains proper status flow

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### Test Case 1: Basic Payment Flow
1. Create a new order with items
2. Add Geidea payment line
3. Complete card payment (should show as 'done')
4. Create new order
5. **Verify**: New payment line starts as 'pending' (not 'done')

### Test Case 2: Multiple Payment Attempts
1. Create order and add Geidea payment
2. Cancel/retry payment multiple times
3. **Verify**: Each attempt resets to 'pending' status
4. Complete payment successfully
5. **Verify**: Only shows 'done' after actual approval

### Test Case 3: Order Switching
1. Create order A with Geidea payment (complete it)
2. Create order B
3. Switch back to order A, then to order B
4. **Verify**: Payment statuses don't cross-contaminate

### Test Case 4: Connection Stability
1. Complete several payments in succession
2. **Verify**: No stale connections or message handlers
3. **Verify**: Each payment gets fresh connection
4. Check console for proper cleanup logs

## 🎯 **Key Implementation Points**

1. **Status Reset Priority**: Always reset `this.status = 'pending'` at the start of `send_payment_request`

2. **Connection Cleanup**: Clear event handlers (`onmessage = null`) before closing connections

3. **Timing Controls**: Use delays (`setTimeout`) to ensure cleanup completion

4. **Order Change Hooks**: Use `onChangeOrder` to detect and handle order switches

5. **Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging payment flows

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Timeout-based cleanup in case of WebSocket issues

---

## 📋 **Files Modified**

1. **`payment.js`**: Main payment interface with enhanced cleanup and status management
2. **`models.js`**: Payment line model with proper initialization  
3. **`payment_screen.js`**: New PaymentScreen extension for order change handling
4. **`__manifest__.py`**: Updated to include new payment screen extension

---

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

After implementing these fixes:

✅ **New payment lines always start with 'pending' status**  
✅ **Previous payment statuses don't persist to new orders**  
✅ **WebSocket connections are completely cleaned up between payments**  
✅ **No stale message handlers processing old responses**  
✅ **Order changes properly reset all payment interfaces**  
✅ **Proper status flow: pending → waiting → done (only on actual approval)**

## 🔧 **Deployment Steps**

1. **Update Module**: Install/upgrade the pos_geidea module
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and restart Odoo
3. **Test Environment**: Test thoroughly in development before production
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch console logs during testing for proper status flows
5. **Verify WebSocket**: Ensure WebSocket ECR server is running and accessible

---

## 📝 **Troubleshooting**

### If payment lines still show 'done' prematurely:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "Resetting Geidea payment interface" messages
2. **Verify Module Load**: Ensure `payment_screen.js` is loaded in browser dev tools
3. **Test Interface Reset**: Manually call `paymentInterface.resetInterface()`
4. **Check WebSocket State**: Verify connections are properly closed between payments

### If connections seem unstable:

1. **Check ECR Server**: Ensure Geidea ECR application is running
2. **Port Conflicts**: Verify no other applications using the same port
3. **Network Issues**: Test WebSocket connection manually
4. **Timeout Adjustments**: Increase cleanup timeout if needed

This comprehensive fix addresses the core issue of payment status persistence across orders and payment attempts, ensuring a clean state for each new payment transaction.
